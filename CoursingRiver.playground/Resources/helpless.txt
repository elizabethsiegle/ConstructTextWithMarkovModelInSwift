Hey hey hey hey (ohh, I do I do I do I)
Dooo Hey (ohh, I do I do I do I)
Boy you got me
Helpless
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in ‘em

I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went boom
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine

Grab my sister, and
Whisper, yo, this one's mine

My sister made her way across the room to you (ooh)
And I got nervous, thinking what's she gonna do? (ooh)
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' I'm through (ooh)
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm (ooh)
Helpless

Oh, look at those eyes

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
I'm helpless
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

I'm helpless

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

Where are you taking me?
I'm about to change your life

Then by all means, lead the way

Elizabeth Schuyler
It's a pleasure to meet you

Schuyler?

My sister

Thank you for all your service

If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

I'll leave you to it

One week later

I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, 'cause she wants to form a harem

I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him

Ha
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
‘Cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you (ooh)
I panic for a second, thinking
We're through (ooh)
But then he shakes your hand and says
Be true (ooh)
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em
I'm helpless

Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in 'em

Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so

Eliza

I've never felt so

My life is gon' be fine 'cause Eliza's in it

I do I do I do I do

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in ‘em

In New York, you can be a new man
In New York, you can be a new man
In New York, you can be a new man

Helpless
